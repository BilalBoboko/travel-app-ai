## Differences
### 1. code implementation
You may find some differences on implementation of functions compared to what in tutorial because I try to use TypeScript and some different logics that is easier to understand and debug

### 2. format for AI generated travel plan
Although I used the exact(I guess) the same prompt as the tutorial, however the output still have some differences in format. Therefore, you may find different attributes and code compared to tutorial.


## Issue
### 1. There are some issues when generating new plan when I writing this note, which says Gemini model not available
